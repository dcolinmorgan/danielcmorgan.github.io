excerpt: 'Recent works in Recommender Systems (RS) have investigated the relationships between the prediction accuracy, i.e. the ability of a RS to minimize a cost function (for instance the RMSE measure) in estimating users&apos; preferences, and the accuracy of the recommendation list provided to users. State-of-the-art recommendation algorithms, which focus on the minimization of RMSE, have shown to achieve weak results from the recommendation accuracy perspective, and vice versa. In this work we present a novel Bayesian probabilistic hierarchical approach for users&apos; preference data, which is designed to overcome the limitation of current method- ologies and thus to meet both prediction and recommendation accuracy. According to the generative semantics of this technique, each user is modeled as a random mixture over latent factors, which identify users community interests. Each individual user community is then modeled as a mixture of topics, which capture the preferences of the members on a set of items. We provide two different formalization of the basic hierarchical model: BH-Forced focuses on rating prediction, while BH-Free models both the popularity of items and the distribution over item ratings. The combined modeling of item popularity and rating provides a powerful framework for the generation of highly accurate recommendations. An extensive evaluation over two popular benchmark datasets reveals the effectiveness and the quality of the proposed algorithms, showing that BH-Free realizes the most satisfactory compromise between prediction and recommendation accuracy with respect to several state- of-the-art competitors.'
