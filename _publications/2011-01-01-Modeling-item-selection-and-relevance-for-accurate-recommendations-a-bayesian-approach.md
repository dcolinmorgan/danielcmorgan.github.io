excerpt: 'We propose a bayesian probabilistic model for explicit preference data. The model introduces a generative process, which takes into account both item selection and rating emission to gather into communities those users who ex- perience the same items and tend to adopt the same rating pattern. Each user is modeled as a random mixture of topics, where each topic is characterized by a distribu- tion modeling the popularity of items within the respective user-community and by a distribution over preference val- ues for those items. The proposed model can be associated with a novel item-relevance ranking criterion, which is based both on item popularity and user’s preferences. We show that the proposed model, equipped with the new ranking criterion, outperforms state-of-art approaches in terms of accuracy of the recommendation list provided to users on standard benchmark datasets.'

We propose a bayesian probabilistic model for explicit preference data. The model introduces a generative process, which takes into account both item selection and rating emission to gather into communities those users who ex- perience the same items and tend to adopt the same rating pattern. Each user is modeled as a random mixture of topics, where each topic is characterized by a distribu- tion modeling the popularity of items within the respective user-community and by a distribution over preference val- ues for those items. The proposed model can be associated with a novel item-relevance ranking criterion, which is based both on item popularity and user’s preferences. We show that the proposed model, equipped with the new ranking criterion, outperforms state-of-art approaches in terms of accuracy of the recommendation list provided to users on standard benchmark datasets.
